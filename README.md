## About
A laptop application to suggest music based on the atmosphere of given image. This is an assignment project for Rutilea selection.

### Non-AI-native application engineering, Task 3
> Developing an application that uses LLM to select music appropriate to the atmosphere of a given photograph. ([Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQRDnBziHUUKzwzlD68ZyD3Bq0XrTHt2dYSwgHeLGP8/edit))

## Usage
### Setup
Entire application is implemented by Python. Before activation, create an environment with `environment.yml`.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Prepare API
Application uses following API keys to function. Please prepare them in advance.
- OpenAI API key : for using GPT-3.5 as LLM in `src/visual_LLM.py`.
- Spotify Client ID & Secret : for using Spotify API in `src/spotify.py`.

### Activation
Run following command in your terminal. Program should be ran in the top directory (`Rutilea`).
```bash
python gui.py
```
